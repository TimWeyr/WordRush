# WordRush Repository Guidelines

- Use UTF-8 encoded text files with Unix line endings.
- Prefer descriptive `const` and `let` declarations in JavaScript; avoid `var`.
- Format JavaScript with two-space indentation and trailing semicolons.
- JSON files must be pretty-printed with two-space indentation and sorted keys where practical.
- Keep HTML structure semantic and include helpful comments for main sections.
- When adding assets or data files, place them under the existing folder structure (`data/`, `assets/`, etc.).
